set up

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

Importing data set into R and examing data

```{r}
cover <- read.csv(here("Data", "donnerville_percent_cover.csv"))
summary(cover)
glimpse(cover)
```

converting the data types of certain columns to factor data and date format

```{r}
cover$Site <- as.factor(cover$Site)
cover$Plot.type <- as.factor(cover$Plot.type)
cover$cover_type <- as.factor(cover$cover_type)
cover$Date <-  dmy(cover$Date)
```

Standardizing data by fixing data entry mistakes

```{r}
fix <- which(cover$cover_type %in% c("Vascular","vascular", "vasc"))
cover$cover_type[fix] <- "Vascular"
```

not sure why this is not standardizing I did it the same way from the notes that I got and poked around on the internet but couldn't find anything helpful. vasc is still vasc but I don't get any sort of error message.
